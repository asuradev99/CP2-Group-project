The Group project for our Computer Programming 2 class.

## Project Ideas

### Esolang (maybe)
Esolangs are "esoteric programming languages", specifically designed to be hard or wierd to program in to challenge the user's programming abilities. Some examples of esolangs can be found here: https://esolangs.org/wiki/Main_Page

### Videogame 
A simple RPG type game with vim style controls, new abilities you get are vim commands, and you fight letters and you can type code in eso langs to make the game easier

### Simple Cellular Automata

A cellular autoamta is a 2-dimension grid of cells whose state evolves over time according to their neighbors. With cellular automata, you can create a complex and diverse array of different behavior. The Game of Life is a popular and simple example of a cellular automata. In the Game of Life, you can create strange and beautiful patterns like flying gliders, blinking oscillators, and even Conway's Game Of Life
